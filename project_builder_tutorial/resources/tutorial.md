Your task is to classify folded lightcurves of potentially periodic variable stars, observed by SuperWASP.

Look at the shape of the folded lightcurve and decide into which category of variable star it should be placed, or whether it is  'junk'. You also need to decide whether the period is correct or not. **Please carefully read the field guide before making a decision.**

**Don't base your classification only on the *average* folded lightcurve (the red line)** - always look at the distribution of white data points too, to get an idea of the overall variability. Each folded lightcurve included here is plotted repeated over two cycles, to help you see any variation.

Also note that for many lightcurves, the classification may *not* be clear - please just classify them as you see fit. *Most* lightcurves will be junk.

-  Pulsators have a single maximum per cycle which is usually narrower than the broad minimum. They will usually have a *steeper rise* and a *shallower decay*. Further examples are in the Help text and Field Guide.

- EA/EB type eclipsing binaries have two V-shaped minima per cycle, usually of different depths. In between the eclipses, the lightcurve may be relatively flat or show some variation in brightness. Sometimes the lightcurve will be folded at *half* the true period so only one maximum and minimum will be seen per cycle. These should still be classified as EA/EB. Further examples are in the Help text and Field Guide.

- EW type eclipsing binaries have two minima per cycle, often of similar depths, with continuously varying brightness throughout the cycle. The minima are narrower than the maxima. Often, these stars will be identified at *half* their true period so only one maximum and minimum per cycle will be seen (as shown below). These should still be classified as EW. Further examples are in the Help text and Field Guide.

- Rotators usually have sinusoidal lightcurves, varying continuously with one maximum and one minimum per cycle, of equal width. Further examples are in the Help text and Field Guide.

**Top Tip**: Turning the folded lightcurve of a rotationally modulated star upside down, it will still look the same shape; turning the folded lightcurve of an EW type star upside down, it will look a different shape.

### Content

- Unknown type are objects that are clearly periodic, but the shape of the modulation does not match that of one of the named types listed.

- Junk lightcurves are everything else - where systematic noise in the data has produced a spurious signal that looks like something periodic - the **majority** of the lightcurves will be junk!
